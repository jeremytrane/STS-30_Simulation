## Overview

STS-30 was the 29th NASA Space Shuttle mission and the fourth flight of Atlantis. Its primary objective was to deploy the Magellan spacecraft, initiating a mission to map the surface of Venus using radar imaging. This simulation aims to replicate the key flight dynamics and mission phases of STS-30.

## Features

- **Aerodynamic Analysis**: Calculates the shuttle's angle of attack and drag forces during ascent.
- **Propulsion Modeling**: Simulates the behavior of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and the Shuttle's main engines, including fuel consumption and thrust variations.
- **Trajectory Simulation**: Models the shuttle's trajectory, accounting for gravitational forces and atmospheric conditions.​
- **Visualization**: Provides animations of the shuttle's ascent, offering visual insights into the mission dynamics.​
