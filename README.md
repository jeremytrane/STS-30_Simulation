## Overview

STS-30 was the 29th NASA Space Shuttle mission and the fourth flight of Atlantis. Its primary objective was to deploy the Magellan spacecraft, initiating a mission to map the surface of Venus using radar imaging. This simulation aims to replicate the key flight dynamics and mission phases of STS-30.

## Features

- **Aerodynamic Modeling**: Simulates the aerodynamic behavior of the Space Shuttle during different flight phases.
- **Mass Properties Calculation**: Computes the center of gravity and mass distribution as fuel is consumed and payload is deployed.
- **Thrust and Trajectory Analysis**: Models the thrust profiles and resulting trajectories during launch and ascent.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeremytrane/STS-30_Simulation.git

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open MATLAB: Navigate to the cloned repository folder within MATLAB.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   Open and configure the relevant MATLAB scripts to set initial conditions and parameters.

2. **Run Simulations**:
   Execute the main simulation scripts to model the shuttle's flight dynamics.
   
3. **Analyze Results**:
   Utilize MATLAB's plotting functions to visualize trajectories, forces, and other pertinent data.
