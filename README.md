# STS-30 Simulation

This project provides a MATLAB-based simulation of NASA's STS-30 mission, which launched the Magellan spacecraft to Venus in 1989. The simulation models various aspects of the Space Shuttle Atlantis's flight dynamics and mission parameters.

## Overview

STS-30 was the 29th NASA Space Shuttle mission and the fourth flight of Atlantis. Its primary objective was to deploy the Magellan spacecraft, initiating a mission to map the surface of Venus using radar imaging. This simulation aims to replicate the key flight dynamics and mission phases of STS-30.

## Features

- **Aerodynamic Modeling**: Simulates the aerodynamic behavior of the Space Shuttle during different flight phases.
- **Mass Properties Calculation**: Computes the center of gravity and mass distribution as fuel is consumed and payload is deployed.
- **Thrust and Trajectory Analysis**: Models the thrust profiles and resulting trajectories during launch and ascent.
