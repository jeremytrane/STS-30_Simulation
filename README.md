## Overview

STS-30 was the 29th NASA Space Shuttle mission and the fourth flight of Atlantis. Its primary objective was to deploy the Magellan spacecraft, initiating a mission to map the surface of Venus using radar imaging. This simulation aims to replicate the key flight dynamics and mission phases of STS-30.

## ðŸš€ Features

This simulation models the flight dynamics of NASA's STS-30 mission, focusing on the ascent of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and deployment of the Magellan spacecraft. It includes detailed aerodynamic, propulsion, and trajectory analysis.

- **Aerodynamic Modeling** â€“ Calculates angle of attack and drag during ascent.
- **Propulsion Simulation** â€“ Models SRB and main engine behavior, including fuel usage and thrust.
- **Trajectory Computation** â€“ Simulates shuttle motion under gravity and atmospheric forces.
- **Data Visualization** â€“ Generates animations for mission visualization.
